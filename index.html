What to Learn? Cognitive Models, Not Specific Operations"></a>1. What to Learn? Cognitive Models, Not Specific Operations</h2><h3 id="Review-of-the-Previous-Two-Models"><a href="#Review-of-the-Previous-Two-Models" class="headerlink" title="Review of the Previous Two Models"></a>Review of the Previous Two Models</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Model 1:</strong> Cognition leads to action, action leads to results. Results are then used to verify cognition.</li>
<li><strong>Model 2:</strong> Theories address generality and simplicity, not accuracy. Accuracy comes from practice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Why-Learn-Cognitive-Models"><a href="#Why-Learn-Cognitive-Models" class="headerlink" title="Why Learn Cognitive Models?"></a>Why Learn Cognitive Models?</h3><p>A cognitive model is a universal framework for judging and understanding the essence of things. It focuses on the overall picture and the big picture, rather than specific operations. By learning cognitive models, we can achieve results in different fields. Accuracy is verified through one’s own practice; this is the core reason we learn cognitive models.</p>
<h2 id="2-Who-to-Learn-From-People-Who-Achieve-Results-in-Different-Fields-Through-Models"><a href="#2-Who-to-Learn-From-People-Who-Achieve-Results-in-Different-Fields-Through-Models" class="headerlink" title="2. Who to Learn From? People Who Achieve Results in Different Fields Through Models"></a>2. Who to Learn From? People Who Achieve Results in Different Fields Through Models</h2><h3 id="Learning-Channels"><a href="#Learning-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Learning Channels"></a>Learning Channels</h3><p>We can learn through books, courses, mentors, etc., but selection is crucial. The core principle is to follow those who have achieved results in different fields. For example, when buying books, choose those recommended or written by people with proven success. Pay attention to the author’s background and whether they have achieved recognized success in a particular field; this is the determining criterion.</p>
<h3 id="Case-Analysis"><a href="#Case-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Case Analysis"></a>Case Analysis</h3><p>Today, there are many online tutorials, but not all instructors have achieved real results. For instance, many people on Douyin (TikTok in China) teach how to use Douyin but don’t have accounts with over 1 million followers themselves. Such individuals lack practical results and are not worth learning from.</p>
<p>When judging whether someone has achieved results in a field, we should focus on their verifiable achievements. For example, has someone working at a company achieved demonstrable performance in their position, and is this performance recognized within the industry? This is our standard for determining whether someone has truly “achieved results.”</p>
<h3 id="Extended-Discussion-What-Does-“Achieving-Results”-Mean"><a href="#Extended-Discussion-What-Does-“Achieving-Results”-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Extended Discussion: What Does “Achieving Results” Mean?"></a>Extended Discussion: What Does “Achieving Results” Mean?</h3><p>People who truly achieve results can do so in multiple different fields. Achieving success in one area might be attributed to luck, but consistently achieving results across different domains indicates a powerful underlying cognitive framework. For example, Leonardo da Vinci achieved outstanding accomplishments in multiple disciplines. Such individuals are worth learning from.</p>
<h2 id="3-How-to-Learn-Don’t-Expect-Complete-Instruction-Practice-What-You-Learn-Gradually-Piece-It-Together"><a href="#3-How-to-Learn-Don’t-Expect-Complete-Instruction-Practice-What-You-Learn-Gradually-Piece-It-Together" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Learn? Don’t Expect Complete Instruction; Practice What You Learn, Gradually Piece It Together"></a>3. How to Learn? Don’t Expect Complete Instruction; Practice What You Learn, Gradually Piece It Together</h2><h3 id="Importance-of-Practice"><a href="#Importance-of-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Practice"></a>Importance of Practice</h3><p>Don’t expect others to teach you everything completely. You should start practicing as soon as you’ve grasped the basics. Only through practice can you verify the accuracy of your cognition. Adopt a “puzzle” mindset, piecing together fragmented knowledge and experience to form your own framework.</p>
<h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>A member of our team, Chuan Zong, has experience at New Oriental, Xueersi, Baidu, and Meituan, where he achieved tangible results. After joining our team, he increased Douyin followers from 2 million to 4.3 million and monthly revenue from ¥200,000 to ¥2,000,000. This isn’t because of a single outstanding skill; it’s because of his robust underlying cognitive framework.</p>
<p>Similarly, Li Guoqing achieved success with Dangdang and is now doing well selling wine on Douyin. This shows his ability to achieve results at different stages.</p>
<h3 id="Continuous-Practice-and-Verification"><a href="#Continuous-Practice-and-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Continuous Practice and Verification"></a>Continuous Practice and Verification</h3><p>The key to learning cognitive models is continuous practice, experimentation, and verification. Make mistakes in the right direction every day, and constantly improve your abilities. Accuracy is something you must achieve through practice; it’s not someone else’s responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><ol>
<li><strong>What to Learn?</strong> Learn cognitive models, not specific operations. Models address generality and simplicity; accuracy requires personal practice.</li>
<li><strong>Who to Learn From?</strong> Choose people who consistently achieve results in different fields and learn from their cognitive frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>How to Learn?</strong> Don’t expect complete instruction; practice what you learn and gradually build your own cognitive model.</li>
</ol>
<p>Through continuous practice and verification, our cognitive models will become increasingly complete, enabling us to achieve results in various fields.</p>

This model primarily answers two questions: What is a problem? And what standards should a good model have?</p>
<h3 id="Core-Idea-of-the-Clock-of-Theory"><a href="#Core-Idea-of-the-Clock-of-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Core Idea of the Clock of Theory"></a>Core Idea of the Clock of Theory</h3><p>The <strong>Clock of Theory</strong> emphasizes that the standards of high cognition include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foresight (Seeing Far):</strong> A person with high cognition can foresee long-term trends, not just short-term phenomena.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Understanding (Seeing All):</strong> Able to have a comprehensive understanding of the situation, but not necessarily able to predict every detail.</li>
<li><strong>Imprecision in Detail (Not Seeing Accurately):</strong> Even with foresight and comprehensive understanding, it is impossible to accurately predict the specific timing and details of events.</li>
</ol>
<p>This view reflects the non-intuitive nature of cognition. Many people believe that high or low cognition depends on whether one can accurately predict the future. However, in reality, the core of cognition lies in grasping future trends, not in the accuracy of details.</p>
<h3 id="Characteristics-of-a-Model"><a href="#Characteristics-of-a-Model" class="headerlink" title="Characteristics of a Model"></a>Characteristics of a Model</h3><p>A good cognitive model should have the following three characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Generality:</strong> The model should have broad applicability. For example, Newton’s Third Law is a theory with broad applicability.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The model should be as simple as possible for easy understanding and application. For example, judging something as “expensive” or “cheap” only focuses on price, neglecting other factors.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The accuracy of a model is often mutually exclusive with its generality and simplicity. A model that simultaneously possesses generality and simplicity often struggles to be precise in specific details.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="The-Clock-of-Theory-and-Managing-Upwards"><a href="#The-Clock-of-Theory-and-Managing-Upwards" class="headerlink" title="The Clock of Theory and Managing Upwards"></a>The Clock of Theory and Managing Upwards</h3><p>In practical applications, such as managing upwards (i.e., communicating with your boss), the Clock of Theory can help us understand how to adjust communication strategies. For example, if the first communication with the boss is unsuccessful, you should continue to adjust methods and try more times, rather than simply denying the model or giving up. A highly cognitive approach involves continuous practice and adjustment, not seeking a one-time solution.</p>
<h3 id="Practice-and-Exercise"><a href="#Practice-and-Exercise" class="headerlink" title="Practice and Exercise"></a>Practice and Exercise</h3><p>In practice, when facing tasks or challenges, a <strong>sense of practice</strong> is very important. Someone with a sense of practice will constantly try and adjust, rather than relying solely on one success or failure. The key to high cognition lies in improving one’s abilities through continuous attempts and optimization, not expecting a single set of models to easily solve all problems.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>The Clock of Theory reminds us that high cognition is not just about precisely grasping details, but about a deep understanding of trends and a comprehensive grasp of problems. An effective model should possess generality and simplicity, while individuals need to continuously adjust and optimize in practice to improve the effectiveness of practical application.</p>

What does it mean? You’ll often find people focusing solely on results, asking, “How do I achieve a specific outcome?” They don’t consider that to achieve a result, an action must first occur. Results don’t magically appear in your mouth or stomach.</p>
<p>Many “lazy questions” aren’t about people not wanting results; they simply don’t want to put in any effort. They hope others will complete tasks for them, demonstrating a reluctance to contribute. These individuals are essentially making requests, even demands, expecting not only answers but also for others to carry out the necessary actions. In essence, they desire the result without the corresponding effort. This attitude offers minimal real-world competitiveness because no one will feed you; everyone must eat for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="Cognition-Systematizing-the-Essence-of-Problems"><a href="#Cognition-Systematizing-the-Essence-of-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Cognition: Systematizing the Essence of Problems"></a>Cognition: Systematizing the Essence of Problems</h2><p>So, how do actions originate? First, you need to establish cognition. Understanding a problem isn’t just a superficial view; it’s a systematized thinking framework. Cognition is about systematically viewing the essence of a problem. Systematization is a concept we’ll discuss extensively in this course. Systematizing cognition helps us understand the core of problems, thus providing guidance for action. Only by seeing through the essence can your actions be sustained.</p>
<p>Many people ask how to persevere. I often reply that it’s because they haven’t clearly seen the essence of the problem. Without grasping the essence, actions don’t receive positive feedback, and you naturally become disinclined to continue. Only a systematic understanding of the essence can sustain action. Actions must constantly be fine-tuned based on specific circumstances to bring about the desired results. By continuously reviewing the results, we can further enhance our ability to systematically understand the essence, forming the “Cognition-Action-Result” cycle.</p>
<h2 id="Action-The-Path-from-Cognition-to-Practice"><a href="#Action-The-Path-from-Cognition-to-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Action: The Path from Cognition to Practice"></a>Action: The Path from Cognition to Practice</h2><p>Remember, after learning this first model, don’t just ask what the result is; ask what the essence of the problem is. Frequently asking “how to do it” or “what to do” only addresses the surface of the problem. The real key is understanding the essence. Only a systematic cognitive understanding leads to effective action and, ultimately, good results. If the result is unsatisfactory, we can adjust our cognition through review, checking for deviations in our understanding of the essence and making improvements.</p>
<h2 id="Result-How-to-Obtain-Expected-Results-through-Action"><a href="#Result-How-to-Obtain-Expected-Results-through-Action" class="headerlink" title="Result: How to Obtain Expected Results through Action"></a>Result: How to Obtain Expected Results through Action</h2><p>In practice, ensuring you enhance your cognition and use a systematic framework to understand problems allows you to take more effective action and achieve better results. By constantly adjusting and optimizing cognition and action, you’ll better achieve your goals and improve your performance in practical application.</p>
<h2 id="Case-Study-Practical-Application-and-Effects"><a href="#Case-Study-Practical-Application-and-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Case Study: Practical Application and Effects"></a>Case Study: Practical Application and Effects</h2><p>Let’s examine some practical cases. For example, the ¥899 career coaching program and the ¥40,000 teacher training course seem vastly different in cost. But from an economic perspective, what defines “expensive”? If you are the end consumer, are you willing to pay for this expense? If the ¥899 training leads to significant career advancement and is covered by your company, its value is justifiable. Similarly, if the ¥40,000 teacher training helps you gain more opportunities and income in your career, it is also justifiable.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-and-Enhancement-How-to-Optimize-the-Cognition-Action-Result-Model"><a href="#Summary-and-Enhancement-How-to-Optimize-the-Cognition-Action-Result-Model" class="headerlink" title="Summary and Enhancement: How to Optimize the Cognition-Action-Result Model"></a>Summary and Enhancement: How to Optimize the Cognition-Action-Result Model</h2><p>Ultimately, using an economic perspective to analyze problems helps us more clearly understand the concepts of “expensive” and “cheap.” When judging the value of anything, we should consider who pays the final cost and whether that cost aligns with a reasonable price. Through this systematic thinking framework, we can more accurately assess and optimize the application of the Cognition-Action-Result framework.</p>

          <p><strong>“Seeing the Mountain and the Water”</strong></p>
<p>Seeing a mountain as a mountain; seeing water as water.<br>Seeing a mountain as no longer a mountain; seeing water as no longer water.<br>Finally, seeing the mountain as a mountain again; seeing water as water again.</p>
<p>At the dawn of human consciousness, perhaps we didn’t ask <em>why</em>. But when did humanity begin to ask? This marks the origin.</p>
<p>Why can frameworks like <strong>“2W1H”</strong> (What, Why, How) be so effective for exploring problems? Why are there exactly three components? Why these three?</p>
<p>We think, but we rarely reflect on the fact that we are thinking.<br>Where does thought originate? The brain.<br>Where does the brain’s power originate? Consciousness.</p>
<p>One key concern of philosophy lies in exploring origins.<br>If humans ask <em>why</em>, what might the result be? Possibly understanding.<br>If humans don’t ask <em>why</em>, the world may simply follow its preordained trajectory.</p>
<p>By constantly pursuing the origins of the world and asking <em>why</em>, we aim to uncover the logic of existence. Beneath this inquiry lies an implicit truth: <strong>causal logic.</strong></p>
<h3 id="The-Illusion-of-Cause-and-Effect"><a href="#The-Illusion-of-Cause-and-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Illusion of Cause and Effect"></a>The Illusion of Cause and Effect</h3><p>It’s difficult to articulate how the brain, before it possesses consciousness, perceives and interprets the world. How does a child understand the world? Do children even think, or is their understanding beyond thinking? After we mature, is our thinking merely a constrained reflection of deeper truths?</p>
<p>The world appears to revolve around causes. At the moment humans ask <em>why</em>, a foundational belief within consciousness emerges—faith in <strong>cause and effect.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve often recalled a scene from the novel <em>Destiny</em> where Han Xin’s perspective shifts as he comes to terms with the existence of extraterrestrial beings. Similarly, <em>New Song</em> left me astonished at how Wang Anshi, despite knowing the future, accepts that this knowledge changes nothing.</p>
<p>One of the immutable rules of this universe seems to be: <em>“Everything happens for a reason.”</em></p>
<p>But is it true?<br>Could absolute faith in causality prevent us from uncovering the roots of the world? Much like we say absolutes are merely special cases in probability, could causality itself be a veneer? What if dark matter forms the majority of existence, and visible matter is just a fragment?</p>
<h3 id="Beyond-Appearances"><a href="#Beyond-Appearances" class="headerlink" title="Beyond Appearances"></a>Beyond Appearances</h3><p>When the essence we firmly believe in turns out to be mere appearance, would you still trust the world?</p>
<p>Our pursuit of “why” shapes our understanding of reality, but the answers we find might only scrape the surface. By questioning causality itself, we might finally begin to see the world for what it truly is.</p>

          <p>The Power of “Letting Things Play Out”</p>
<p>When Jiang Wen’s film <em>Let the Bullets Fly</em> was released, it was a sensation. However, I didn’t fully grasp the meaning of “让子弹飞” (Ràng zǐdàn fēi - Let the bullets fly) at the time. Over the years, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of these four characters.</p>
<p>Philosophy tells us we need to look at problems “dynamically.” Often, we view them “statically,” even when we believe we are thinking dynamically.</p>
<p>Motion and stillness are relative concepts in physics. What we truly need to understand is to avoid looking at things in isolation or with a one-sided perspective.</p>
<p>I recently came across a quote: “Spending two years figuring something out is not a waste of life.” It was very healing for me.</p>
<p>Indeed, how many two-year periods do we have in a lifetime?</p>
<p>Three years after three years, or perhaps, “Do you know how I’ve spent the last five years?”</p>
<p>Movies often portray years as having special significance, but in the face of certain problems, years are just abstract numbers. Sometimes they carry immense weight, and sometimes they are insignificant.</p>
<p>Similarly, philosophical questions pondered by humans two or three thousand years ago are still being debated today. Perhaps these questions will remain unanswered until the Earth’s demise.</p>
<p>In reality, we often don’t need to make specific judgments or draw conclusions about current events. The tide might recede, revealing who was swimming naked.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of history, who is right and who is wrong? Do the flowers still bloom for those who were wrongly accused, those who were wronged?</p>
<p>Recently, while watching a documentary about Su Bingtian on Bilibili (B站), many viewers mentioned Liu Xiang’s performance at the 2008 Olympics. Some only remembered his withdrawal from the race. Many people’s hopes of witnessing Liu Xiang’s “flying man” performance were shattered, leading to countless criticisms and accusations on social media. Numerous commercial endorsements were quickly canceled, and it seemed the whole world was against Liu Xiang.</p>
<p>What did he do wrong to deserve such treatment? Fortunately, years later, many people have come to Liu Xiang’s defense, but the hero is now past his prime.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Su Bingtian encountered a bottleneck in his sprinting career, he chose to switch his leading foot. This initially made him even slower than before. Thankfully, he persevered and later achieved remarkable results.</p>
<p>Our Earth, our solar system, our Milky Way galaxy—they are all flying through the depths of the universe. What does the future hold?</p>
<p>Indeed, who knows?</p>
<p>Let the bullets fly for a while. Let ourselves fly for a while longer. Perhaps then, there will be answers.</p>

          <h1 id="You-Are-Not-Me-How-Do-You-Know-I-Don’t-Know-the-Joy-of-Fish-On-the-Curse-of-Knowledge"><a href="#You-Are-Not-Me-How-Do-You-Know-I-Don’t-Know-the-Joy-of-Fish-On-the-Curse-of-Knowledge" class="headerlink" title="You Are Not Me, How Do You Know I Don’t Know the Joy of Fish? (On the Curse of Knowledge)"></a>You Are Not Me, How Do You Know I Don’t Know the Joy of Fish? (On the Curse of Knowledge)</h1><p>I recently watched a video by Dong Yuhui discussing the “curse of knowledge,” a concept also mentioned by Fan Deng. It’s a compelling idea.</p>
<p>It essentially describes how, in conversations, we tend to judge another person’s understanding based on our own perspective. Once we’ve grasped a piece of knowledge, it becomes challenging to consider things from the viewpoint of someone who hasn’t yet learned it.</p>
<p>The “curse of knowledge” was first identified in a 1990 experiment by Elizabeth Newton, a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University (not Harvard, as Fan Deng mistakenly stated).</p>
<p>In her experiment, a “tapper” tapped out the melody of a well-known song (like “Happy Birthday”) on a table, while a “listener” attempted to identify the song. This seemingly simple study contributed to her earning a Ph.D. in psychology.</p>
<p>The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias. Common phrases like, “I can’t believe they don’t understand,” “I can’t follow their logic,” or “How can they not grasp something so simple?” often reflect this bias.</p>
<h2 id="The-Root-of-the-Problem"><a href="#The-Root-of-the-Problem" class="headerlink" title="The Root of the Problem"></a>The Root of the Problem</h2><p>Why does this phenomenon occur?</p>
<p>This issue frequently arises when practicing the Feynman Technique. Explaining a concept you find simple and already understand clearly to someone else is a true test of understanding and communication skills.</p>
<p>Two key elements are crucial for effective communication in these situations: acceptance and a focus on the process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Are you willing to accept that the other person might not understand initially? Can you accept their different perspective? Can you embrace differences of opinion?</li>
<li><strong>Process Orientation:</strong> This is about having patience and understanding that learning takes time. It’s a gradual process that requires a certain rhythm and pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>This requires conscious effort; the initial intention (起心, <em>qǐ xīn</em>) is paramount.</p>
<p>The term “curse of knowledge” was coined by economists Colin Camerer, George Loewenstein, and Martin Weber in a 1989 article published in the <em>Journal of Political Economy</em>. Their research aimed to challenge the assumption in asymmetric information analysis that more informed agents can accurately predict the judgments of less informed ones.</p>
<p>Zen Buddhism also touches upon this with the concept of “beginner’s mind,” which encourages maintaining an open, eager, and unbiased attitude—like a beginner—even at advanced levels of learning. This embodies an empty cup mentality, shunning arrogance. Teachers and managers especially should grasp this; a lack of understanding from the top down can lead to negative outcomes. Dialogue from an equal perspective is always preferable.</p>
<h2 id="The-Zhuangzi-and-the-Joy-of-Fish"><a href="#The-Zhuangzi-and-the-Joy-of-Fish" class="headerlink" title="The Zhuangzi and the Joy of Fish"></a>The Zhuangzi and the Joy of Fish</h2><p>The <em>Zhuangzi</em> (Autumn Floods) offers a classic illustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zhuangzi said, “The minnows come out and freely enjoy themselves—this is the happiness of fishes.”</p>
<p>Huizi said, “You are not a fish; how do you know the happiness of fishes?”</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said, “You are not I; how do you know I do not know the happiness of fishes?”</p>
<p>Huizi said, “I am not you; I certainly do not know you. You are certainly not a fish; your not knowing the happiness of fishes is complete.”</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said, “Let’s get back to the original point. When you said ‘How do you know the happiness of fishes?’ you already knew that I knew it, and then asked me. I know it on the Hao River.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dialogue highlights the difficulty of understanding another’s experience from an external perspective, echoing the core problem of the curse of knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="Overcoming-the-Curse"><a href="#Overcoming-the-Curse" class="headerlink" title="Overcoming the Curse"></a>Overcoming the Curse</h2><p>When we understand the curse of knowledge, how do we help others understand it?</p>
<p>For the other party, there’s often no easy solution unless they possess the aforementioned acceptance and process orientation and are willing to acknowledge their own limitations.</p>
<p>The “curse” implies an inherent difficulty in bridging the gap in understanding, similar to the Trisolarans in <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>, who struggle to comprehend human deception.</p>
<p>For ourselves, the solution lies in continuous cognitive iteration, elevated thinking, stepping outside our own perspective, and accepting others’ lack of comprehension. This requires empathy and a constant effort to re-evaluate our assumptions.</p>

          <p>From A to B</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <em>Become a SuperLearner</em> recently, which discusses learning from a teacher’s perspective—a very insightful angle.</p>
<p>One teaching method mentioned is inquiry-based learning.</p>
<p>It also mentions that when we consider a problem, we often ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this?</li>
<li>How does it work?</li>
<li>Why X, Y, Z?</li>
<li>What will happen next?</li>
<li>How to get from A to B?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a good problem-solving paradigm, an expansion of “2W1H” (What, Why, How).</p>
<p>Recently, during the 14th session of the NoteMan Camp and with new employees at my company, I noticed that people easily encounter the problem of not clearly defining what getting from A to B means.</p>
<p>For example, many campers aim to earn credits, become note-taking masters, or create beautiful vertical mind maps and knowledge cards. Many campers discuss specific methods of using various tools daily, but very few focus on the logic behind note-taking, why we take notes, and what notes can bring us.</p>
<p>Another example: when software engineers are programming, they easily forget the requirements, especially when they encounter technical bottlenecks and can’t solve a problem. Eventually, time runs out, and the task is not completed.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, it turns out they’ve been stuck on a specific technical detail for a long time, focusing on a specific technical detail rather than the business problem. Further questioning reveals that a manual solution could resolve the issue in minutes.</p>
<p>If they had a piece of A4 paper and a pen to simply outline the problem and define B, they might have found a new answer.</p>
<p>I sometimes think that while the world is complex, it’s also very simple at times—so simple that you can see the destination at a glance.</p>
<p>However, some people’s paths to the destination are direct, while others are winding, and some may not reach it at all.</p>
<p>“We already walked too far, down to we had forgotten why embarked.” – Kahlil Gibran</p>
<p>I first encountered this quote many years ago through Chai Jing’s <em>Seeing</em> (看见) and then found the book <em>Don’t Forget Why You Started: Chen Meng, We Hear You</em> (不要因为走得太远而忘记为什么出发：陈虻，我们听你讲), which is also excellent.</p>
<p>The busier and more anxious we are, the more we should stop and think about our original intentions.</p>
<p>As for what A is, what B is, and how to quickly get from A to B, this may require thinking and practice based on various life experiences.</p>
<p>But try to stop and think. One day or two, an answer will emerge at some point.</p>

          <h1 id="My-Existence-Utterly-Fortunate"><a href="#My-Existence-Utterly-Fortunate" class="headerlink" title="My Existence: Utterly Fortunate"></a>My Existence: Utterly Fortunate</h1><h2 id="On-Fortune-and-Existence"><a href="#On-Fortune-and-Existence" class="headerlink" title="On Fortune and Existence"></a>On Fortune and Existence</h2><p>I’ve recently noticed that since our company welcomed Gen Z colleagues, I’ve started jokingly referring to myself as “old.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, I still feel young at heart. I maintain a fondness for exploring new things in the world, holding onto a bit of remaining curiosity, and I enjoy chatting with them and understanding their world.</p>
<p>Over the years, I’ve increasingly felt that “fortune” is truly precious—so precious that I realize some events and some people, once missed, are truly gone forever. Meeting them is indeed incredibly fortunate.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I feel as though I’ve taken many detours, I especially cherish those intersections that are so rare and hard-won.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I solidified two paradigms for understanding the world: one is logic, which confirms that the world <em>can</em> be understood; and the other is probability—many outcomes are simply a matter of chance.</p>
<p>I often tell my younger colleagues that reliability is much more important than absolute accuracy. In this world, nothing is ever one hundred percent certain. When you are more than sixty percent certain, you can move forward.</p>
<p>I used to find the concept of “destiny” hard to believe. But now, after continuously exploring philosophy, I’m inclined to believe in a creator. Unfortunately, based on our current understanding, Earth is the only planet we know of that harbors life. That I happen to exist within this civilization and leave even a small trace is truly fortunate. And within this context, the people you meet and the events you encounter are even more so.</p>
<p>Fortune has gradually become a luxury for me. I’ve started paying closer attention to my focus, almost fearing that life is too short to waste large amounts of time on unimportant matters. I’m also incredibly willing to dedicate limitless, lifelong time to the people and things that have been healing for me.</p>
<p>Many years ago, during the early days of my entrepreneurial venture, several of us were working around a small desk when a colleague, while reading a book, suddenly burst into tears. We were completely at a loss, filled with questions.</p>
<p>Years later, while reading myself, I would also, at any time, in any place, and under any circumstances, be profoundly healed by a certain sentence or concept, moved to tears and a state of complete absorption.</p>
<p>In Fu Peirong’s lectures on Western philosophy, he discusses Heraclitus, one of whose ideas is that all things are logic.</p>
<p>When I read this, I felt deeply that some things truly transcend time and space. I finally understood why Steve Jobs was willing to trade all his wealth for an afternoon with Socrates.</p>
<p>Because suddenly, you realize that in this incredibly complex world, thousands of years ago, someone shared your way of understanding it. This realization is incredibly moving.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if it is because of endlessly exploring the reality of the world that I have become fortunate or if it is because I am fortunate that I began to explore this endless world’s reality.</p>
<p>Perhaps probability is the truth of this world. My existence is utterly fortunate.</p>

<li><p>There are many ways to create notes, and many tools available. Finding the one that suits you best is the most important thing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learning new knowledge is a gradual process that requires “deliberate practice” and a “beginner’s mind” (empty cup mentality).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whether it’s information, knowledge, cognition, or notes, we ultimately need to understand the underlying essence and logic. Focus on the principles and methods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Goals are very important. Planning is essential because an adult’s time is the most precious resource. How to learn effectively within a given time, or even learn more, requires focus and proper methods. The more detailed the task breakdown, the more thorough the preparation and effort, the greater the gains.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“When three walk together, at least one can be my teacher.” (Confucius). We are fortunate to have met. Frequent communication will spark more excellent ideas, leading to more learning and growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I am your dedicated teaching assistant, ONE. The more proactive and engaged you are, the more you will gain. Feel free to message me privately with any questions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Shanghai · 20220708</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Focus: Problems&#x2F;goals can be further focused.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In this era of overwhelming information noise, our attention is extremely precious. We are sometimes too easily led astray by this noise. So, we can stop and ask ourselves: What is the most specific problem I am currently focused on?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sometimes, it’s because we want too much, too big, too broad. Perhaps, right now, understanding the concept of “knowledge” from a single lesson is more important than building an entire knowledge system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Rhythm: Perhaps too fast, perhaps too slow, what is just right?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everyone’s situation is different, their experiences are different, and their understanding and pursuit of things will also be different. But no matter what others do, it’s their own business. My [ONE] understanding of this world is ultimately just a personal understanding and pursuit. Therefore, focusing on one’s own growth and mastering one’s own rhythm is very important. I think one’s own rhythm simply means that today I learned a new piece of knowledge, and I may have a new understanding of something. In the future, I will connect these perspectives and understandings to form my worldview—this is my knowledge system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Many things are “traceable.” We just need to proceed step by step, and we will eventually achieve our goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Positive Attitude: A positive attitude is a catalyst for growth. Thinking positively, exploring actively, and communicating proactively will all lead to rapid personal growth.</p>
</li>
</ol>

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Recently, I’ve been reading “傅佩荣的西方哲学课” (Fu Peirong’s Western Philosophy Course) and have completed about 10% of the first round. At this pace, it feels like it will take half a year to finish, but I’m reading carefully and gaining a lot.</p>
<p>I had long heard that Steve Jobs was willing to trade his lifetime of technological achievements and wealth for an afternoon with the philosopher Socrates.</p>
<p>Initially, my understanding was simply that both Socrates and Jobs were remarkable figures, and Jobs believed he could extract valuable insights from Socrates.</p>
<p>Since beginning my exploration of the realm of cognition, many fragmented insights have accumulated. Now, within this philosophical system, I’ve finally found solace. It turns out that the various problems I’ve encountered were also faced by philosophers two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Human nature largely involves trying to prove one’s own ideas are correct. Discovering like-minded individuals inevitably leads to a feeling of profound connection, like meeting a long-lost friend after a thousand cups of wine. Such encounters are rare, leading to sighs of感慨 (gǎnkǎi, sighs of feeling).</p>
<p>For example, reading about Socrates’s death, I was shocked to learn that he chose to face death to uphold the law. This transcendence of life and death is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>This finally helped me understand why Jobs was willing to give up his entire fortune for a conversation with him.</p>
<p>For instance, while reading about Heraclitus, I discovered his belief that logic underlies everything in the world.</p>
<p>This happens to be an insight I’ve recently gained, and I was deeply moved to find that these ancestors had already pointed in this direction.</p>
<p>These philosophers often couldn’t escape studying theology. One often hears that philosophy has its roots in theology.</p>
<p>However, this “theology” isn’t the “ghosts and spirits” we commonly understand. In my view, it’s akin to “神即道，道法自然” (shén jí dào, dào fǎ zìrán - God is the Tao, the Tao follows nature), the natural laws governing the universe.</p>
<p>Understanding the world ultimately boils down to one’s worldview—认知 (rènzhī, cognition) is simply the cognition of one’s worldview.</p>
<p>This is another conclusion I’ve recently reached, and it resonates deeply.</p>
<p>Philosophy pursues a “low-profile attitude towards life”—peace, tranquility, and balance.</p>
<p>This has always been the state of mind I’ve sought, an inner equilibrium that has eluded me for so long. Thankfully, the path of philosophy offers some consolation.</p>
<p>Descartes said, “Everyone should, at least once in their life, doubt everything that can be doubted.”</p>
<p>I interpret this as a kind of “rebirth,” a transformation from sensibility to rationality, a process of metamorphosis for being human.</p>
<p>Confucius said: “朝闻道，夕死可矣” (zhāo wén dào, xī sǐ kě yǐ - If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die content at dusk).</p>
